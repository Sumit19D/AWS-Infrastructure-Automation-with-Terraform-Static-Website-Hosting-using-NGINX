# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform


##  📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end AWS infrastructure automation using Terraform to provision cloud resources and deploy a static web application hosted on NGINX.
The goal of this project is to showcase hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud provisioning, and web server configuration.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS

* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform

* **Compute Service:** Amazon EC2

* **Networking:** VPC, Subnet, IGW, Route Table, Security Groups

* **Web Server:** NGINX

* **Operating System:** Amazon Linux / Ubuntu

* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub


## ⚙️ Infrastructure Automation Details

* Terraform is used to automatically provision AWS resources

* EC2 instance is launched inside a public subnet

* Security Groups are configured to allow:
  * SSH access for administration
  * HTTP/HTTPS access for web traffic

* NGINX is installed and configured using Terraform user_data

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deploying this project, ensure the following tools and configurations are available on your system:

🔹 1️⃣ Terraform

Terraform is required to provision AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Install Terraform from: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads

Verify installation:

* terraform --version

🔹 2️⃣ AWS CLI

AWS CLI is required for authentication and interaction with AWS services.

Install AWS CLI from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

Verify installation:

* aws --version

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

* git clone https://github.com/Sumit19D/AWS-Infrastructure-Automation-with-Terraform.git

* cd AWS-Infrastructure-Automation-with-Terraform

2️⃣ Connect to AWS

* aws configure

3️⃣ Initialize Terraform

* terraform init

4️⃣ Validate the Configuration

* terraform validate

5️⃣ Apply Terraform Configuration

* terraform apply --auto-approve

## 🌐 Access the Application

Once deployment is complete, Terraform outputs the public IP of the EC2 instance.

Access the static website in a browser:

http://(EC2-PUBLIC-IP)

## 🧹 Clean Up Resources

To avoid unnecessary AWS charges:

* terraform destroy
